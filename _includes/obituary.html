                    <p><br><br> Overall the project was a learning experience in group work, humility, and large intertwined code bases. The material of the class and the actual groupwork were like peanutbutter and jelly, the complemented eachother well. Utalizing the agile methodology,SOLID principles, and n-tiered architercture were crucial for the success we had acheived, and when ignored contributed to our failures.</p>
                    <h2 id="what-was-the-overall-architecture-of-your-system-particularly-if-it-is-different-from-the-demo-system">What was the overall architecture of your system (particularly if it is different from the demo system)?</h2>
                        <p><br><br> We stuck fairly close to the three tiered architecture that we had learnt about in class, as well as was provided in the sample project. Our architecture was fairly different compared to the sample project. 
                    <h2> What went right in the development process?</h2>
                        <p></p><br><br> During the development process our group held a high standard to communication, and freely sharing ideas. In general we had a very healthy group dynamic. There was this general understanding of obligations outside of the course and how we are all have other academic obligations. We had several meetings outside of class. This helped everyone stay up to date with the project even if they didn’t have time to work on it. There was always a concept of we win together we lose together so there was never any real tension or communication break downs.</p>
                    <h2>What went wrong in the development process, and what would we do differently if had to start over? </h2>
                        <p></p><br><br> Initially we had very high expectations on what could be accomplished and we spread out too far instead of building solid foundations. This hurt our second iteration which we had to sink a lot of time in to accomplish very little. We did rebound from this in the last iteration and implemented quite a bit, while fixing alot. If we could start over, we would defintely focus on a small group of objects first, and building out from that. For example, instead of focusing user crednetial login firsts, we should have focused on getting a robust UI that we could grow instead of a authentication process. It would have been easy to add that to a chain of responsibility. As well, having a better architecture diagram and planning it together would have been worth the time investment over trying to learn and add to unplanned code. This sort of touches on what is discussed in our retrospective, where if we had changed our velocity expectations and used our time for more effecient task than a wide range of different tasks. In a sense we were doing “shotgun surgery” and spreading our work out too far. This is why if we could start again, putting more effort into planning in our early iterations, and getting some idea written down instead of “the right idea” written down would have been helpful. <br><br></p>
                    <h2 id="can-you-draw-any-conclusions-from-what-youve-done">Can you drawany conclusions from what you’ve done?</h2>
                        <p><br><br> There is lots to be concluded from this project. Firstly group work is hard, but worth the effort. There is very little chance that any one person can  accomplish what we did as a team. Group work also does come with some complications, but with good communication we managed to mitagate most of them. As far as the software development went, Android Studio is a great peice of software that massively helps us in our project. There was a fairly large learning curve when it came to developing software with other people, especially with integration. With the use of testing suites and tools like Junit, Mockito, and Espresso we could really test our features well before integration. Sometimes we did not utiize them enough, but we eventually did to ensure a boarder range of functionality is tested. They would have helped us tackle some debugging. A good portion of the troubles came from the database, it took a while to get functioning, and because of that our integration across layers was late to be tested. This was one of the larger hiccups and was just a part of the development process. We over estimated our abilities, while under  estiamting the difficulties. This is where the agile methodology really helped. It allowed us to learn and adjust during the development process. As mentioned in our retrospective we had the ability to get a bunch of features done, but we didn’t have the UI to display and access them. Going back to what was previously stated it would have potentially been a better use of time early on to have a more robust UI infulstructure to add onto.</p>
